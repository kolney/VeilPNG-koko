VeilPNG 
=================

VeilPNG is a powerful utility designed to securely hide sensitive data within PNG images using strong 
encryption and compression techniques. It allows you to embed any file into a PNG image by compressing the 
data and encrypting it with a password using AES-256-GCM encryption. The encryption key is derived from your 
password using PBKDF2 with HMAC-SHA256, utilizing a unique salt and a high iteration count to enhance security 
against brute-force attacks.

The encrypted data is stored within a custom ancillary chunk in the PNG file format, ensuring the image 
remains valid while concealing the hidden content. You can later extract the hidden file by providing the correct 
password, which also verifies data integrity through an HMAC-SHA256 hash.

sVeil is a variant of VeilPNG that embeds hidden data directly into the deflate stream of the PNG image's IDAT 
chunk. This method allows for secure storage of hidden files within the PNG image without using custom ancillary 
chunks, enhancing stealth. The hidden data is appended to the trailing data of the deflate stream, ensuring that 
the PNG remains valid according to the PNG specification.

3. WHEN TO USE VEILPNG AND WHEN TO USE SVEIL:

### VeilPNG

Use VeilPNG when:

- **Embedding Larger Files**: Ideal for hiding larger files or more data efficiently.
- **Image Integrity is Critical**: The image must remain visually intact without any corruption.
- **Maximum Compatibility**: The PNG file should remain valid and compatible with all image viewers and editors.
- **Strong Security Measures**: Requires encryption and data integrity verification using AES-256-GCM and HMAC-SHA256.
- **Avoiding Image Corruption**: Any image corruption is unacceptable for your use case.

### sVeil

Use sVeil when:

- **Maximum Stealth is Required**: Embeds data directly into the deflate stream for enhanced concealment.
- **Hiding Smaller Amounts of Data**: Best suited for smaller files to minimize changes in image size.
- **Custom Chunk Removal Risk**: There's a risk that custom chunks may be removed by image editors or web services.
- **Acceptable Minor Image Changes**: Slight image modifications are acceptable for your use case.
- **Bypassing Basic Analysis**: Embedding within the deflate stream makes hidden data less detectable by standard analysis tools.

---------------------------------------

4. SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS:

- **Encryption**: Utilizes AES-256-GCM for robust encryption and data integrity.
- **Key Derivation**: Employs PBKDF2 with HMAC-SHA256, a 16-byte salt, and 100,000 iterations for secure key derivation.
- **Data Integrity**: Uses HMAC-SHA256 to verify that the data has not been altered.
- **Password Strength**: Enforces strong passwords to prevent unauthorized access.
- **Secure Memory Handling**: Sensitive data is securely erased from memory after use.
- **Random Padding**: Adds randomness to prevent size-based analysis (in VeilPNG).
- **Stealth Techniques**: sVeil embeds data within the deflate stream to enhance stealth.

---------------------------------------

## Additional Notes

- **Twitter Users**: If you plan to share your PNG images on Twitter, ensure your images are within Twitter's size limits—900 pixels (width/height) and a total file size (image + hidden data) below 5 MB to avoid automatic conversion to JPEG format, which would strip the hidden data.
- **Password Requirements**: For maximum security, use a password that includes uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters, and is at least 12 characters long.

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

**Q1: Can I hide multiple files at once?**

- **A**: Currently, VeilPNG supports embedding one file at a time. To hide multiple files, you can compress them into a single archive (e.g., ZIP) before embedding.

**Q2: Is there a size limit for the file I can hide?**

- **A**: The size is limited by the maximum file size that can be handled by the PNG format and practical considerations regarding the resulting image size.

**Q3: Can I use my own images as carrier PNGs?**

- **A**: Yes, you can use any valid PNG image as the carrier for your hidden data.

**Q4: Is the hidden data detectable by analysis tools?**

- **A**: While VeilPNG and sVeil employ methods to conceal data, advanced forensic tools may detect anomalies. sVeil offers enhanced stealth by embedding data within the deflate stream.

**Q5: What happens if someone tries to extract data without the correct password?**

- **A**: Extraction will fail, and the hidden data will remain secure. Multiple incorrect attempts do not compromise the encryption.

**Q6: What are the Twitter size limits for posting images without conversion to JPEG?**

- **A**: For Twitter, ensure your PNG images are no larger than 900 pixels in either width or height and keep the combined file size (image + hidden data) below 5 MB. Exceeding these limits may cause Twitter to convert the image to JPEG, which would remove any hidden data.
